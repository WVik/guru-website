It is believed that performing the Satyanarayan Puja during this time can bring additional spiritual benefits and blessings.\n\n**Rituals:**\n1. **Preparation:** The host prepares for the puja by cleaning the house, decorating the altar or puja space with flowers and rangoli, and gathering the necessary items for the ritual.\n2. **Invocations:** The puja begins with the chanting of prayers and the invocation of Lord Satyanarayan. A kalash (brass or copper pot) filled with water, mango leaves, and a coconut is placed as a symbol of abundance and purity.\n3. **Narration of the Katha:** The heart of the Satyanarayan Puja is the recitation of the Satyanarayan Katha (story). The story narrates the significance of the puja and the blessings it brings. A priest or the host himself can recite the Katha.\n4. **Offerings:** Devotees offer various items to the deity, including fruits, sweets, rice, coconut, and flowers. These offerings are made as a gesture of devotion and gratitude.\n5. **Aarti:** Aarti (ceremonial waving of light) is performed using a lamp or camphor flame. Devotees wave the flame in a clockwise direction in front of the deity, accompanied by the singing of Aarti hymns.\n6. **Distribution of Prasad:** After the puja and Aarti, the prasad (blessed offerings) is distributed to all attendees. This prasad is considered sacred and is consumed as a form of divine blessing.\n\nThe Satyanarayan Puja is not only a religious observance but also a way to foster a sense of unity, devotion, and community among family members and friends. It's believed that performing this puja with sincerity and devotion can bring blessings, positivity, and harmony into one's life."
